# Let's Talk

The purpose of this project is to hack the current way citizens have conversations with other citizens about important social and political issues. 

Especially with the recent 2016 election, social media has become overrun with people talking about one political opinion or another, complete with memes, hashtags, and calls to action. Most of the time, people either do not interact with people of opposing political beliefs, but this particular election has brought out much more disagreement and dissent than we have seen in a long time. 

Political conversations easily get heated, but that is not necessarily productive for the conversation, as it does not get to the root issues and becomes a circular yelling/insult contest. Here, I offer tools for hard discussions that intentionally limit conversation in order to get down to what really matters, and hopefully assist in a mutual conclusion. 

The project is, in its design, itterative. Tools will be altered and updated based on user experience. 


### Take Your Time (name pending): 
Choose topic issue, post opinion and choose predetermined opinion tags
- Opinion character limit - 140 (tweet length)
- Uses IP address, forcing user to wait 30(?) minutes between posts
- Upvotes and downvotes on opinions require reason
	- "I agree" or "I disagree" are not strong enough reasons
- Users can filter opinions by tags and upvote/downvote

### Affect (name pending): 
Users answer the question of "how does this affect me" when it comes to policies, laws, and development 
- Learning goal: users learn about current policies, and how they are affected 
- Responses are MadLibs style
	- policy/law/development plan + " affects me because it " + [does something] + " which then causes " + [something]
- Tool consolidates live data into simple visualizations
